Okay, I agree. Let's break this down into a phased plan to implement the "Site Settings" functionality, including all your requested features and the additional ones we discussed.

Development Plan: Site Settings Feature

Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Initial Settings

Step 1: Create SiteSetting Database Model
File: app/models.py
Action: Define a new SQLAlchemy model named SiteSetting.
Fields:
id (Integer, Primary Key)
site_title (String, default: "My Blog")
site_description (Text, nullable)
site_domain (String, nullable, e.g., "https://www.example.com")
favicon_url (String, nullable, for URL to favicon image)
posts_per_page (Integer, default: 10)
admin_email (String, nullable)
admin_github_url (String, nullable)
ad_sense_code (Text, nullable, for ad snippets)
google_analytics_id (String, nullable)
footer_copyright_text (String, nullable, default: "Â© {year} {site_title}. All rights reserved.")
Logic: We'll ensure only one record of settings exists, typically by fetching SiteSetting.query.first() and creating a default if none is found.
Step 2: Database Migration
Tool: Flask-Migrate
Action:
Generate a new migration script: flask db migrate -m "Add SiteSetting model"
Apply the migration: flask db upgrade
Step 3: Create SiteSettingsForm
File: app/forms.py
Action: Define a new Flask-WTF form named SiteSettingsForm.
Fields: Corresponding to the SiteSetting model, using appropriate WTForms fields (e.g., StringField, TextAreaField, IntegerField, URLField).
Validators: Include Optional(), URL(), Email(), NumberRange() as needed.
Step 4: Implement admin.settings Route and Basic Template
File (Route): app/routes_admin.py
Action (Route):
Create a new route /admin/settings (methods: GET, POST) under the admin_bp blueprint, protected by @admin_required.
GET: Fetch the SiteSetting record (or create default). Populate SiteSettingsForm with this data.
POST: Validate the form. If valid, update the SiteSetting record in the database and flash a success message.
Render a new template.
File (Template): app/templates/admin/settings.html
Action (Template): Create a new HTML template that extends base.html (or an admin base template if you have one). Display the SiteSettingsForm, including a submit button.
Phase 2: Integrating Settings into the Application

Step 5: Create Context Processor for Site Settings
File: app/__init__.py (or a new app/context_processors.py)
Action: Define a context processor function that queries the SiteSetting record (handling the case where it might not exist yet by providing defaults) and makes it available to all templates (e.g., as g.site_settings or site_settings).
Step 6: Update Templates to Use Dynamic Settings
app/templates/base.html:
Update <title> tag to use {{ site_settings.site_title }}.
Add <meta name="description" content="{{ site_settings.site_description }}">.
Add <link rel="icon" href="{{ site_settings.favicon_url or url_for('static', filename='favicon.ico') }}"> (provide a default favicon).
Conditionally include Google Analytics script using {{ site_settings.google_analytics_id }}.
Update footer to use {{ site_settings.footer_copyright_text }} (allowing for dynamic year and site title).
app/templates/_navbar.html:
Optionally, change the navbar brand text to {{ site_settings.site_title }}.
Other templates: Inject {{ site_settings.ad_sense_code|safe }} in appropriate places (e.g., sidebar, between posts). Be mindful of the |safe filter.
Step 7: Update Logic to Use Settings
app/routes_public.py (post_list route): Modify pagination logic to use site_settings.posts_per_page.
Phase 3: Testing and Refinement

Step 8: Thorough Testing
Verify that all settings can be updated from the admin page.
Confirm that changes are reflected correctly on the public-facing site.
Test edge cases (e.g., empty optional fields).
Ensure the site still functions if settings haven't been configured yet (defaults should apply).
This plan provides a clear path. I will start with Phase 1, Step 1: Create SiteSetting Database Model in app/models.py.

Are you ready for me to proceed with defining the model?
