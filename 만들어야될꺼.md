Content Management Enhancements:
Search and Filtering for Posts: As your blog grows, it will be helpful to quickly find posts. You could add a search bar (to search by title or content) and filters (e.g., by date, by tag, by published/draft status).
Tag/Category Management: You have a "태그" (Tags) column. A dedicated section to create, edit, delete, and manage tags (or categories) would be very useful. This would allow you to easily organize and assign them to posts.
Post Status (Draft/Published): Allow saving posts as drafts before publishing them. The dashboard could then indicate the status of each post.
Bulk Actions: The ability to select multiple posts and perform actions like "delete" or "publish/unpublish" simultaneously.
Basic Analytics/Statistics:
Total Posts: A simple display of the total number of published posts, draft posts, etc.
Recent Activity: Maybe a small section showing recently published posts or recent comments (if you add a comment system).
(Optional) View Counts: If you decide to track post views, displaying the most popular posts or view counts per post could be insightful.
Comment Management (if you plan to have comments):
A section to view, approve, reply to, and delete comments.
Spam filtering integration or manual spam marking.
User Management (if you plan to have multiple authors/users):
List users, add new users, edit user roles (e.g., admin, editor, author).
Ability for users to manage their own profiles (change password, email, etc. - some of this might be in "설정").
Site Settings (expanding on your current "설정" link):
General Settings: Blog title, tagline, posts per page, date/time format.
Navigation Menu Management: If you want a customizable main navigation menu for the public site.
Theme/Appearance Options: More detailed control over the look and feel if you plan for it.
